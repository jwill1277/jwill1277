## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe, and I'm a data analyst with experience across the data spectrum from business intelligence, data analysis, data engineering, and data science. 


- ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to explore more ways to extract useful charts and insights from my Garmin Forerunner.
  - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Garmin related projects!
        Specifically:\
            1) extract lap times to create a chart of lap-specific times to assess pace/mile as opposed to total pace/total miles \
            2) track periods of times, and base pace versus tempo pace \
            3) see if there are other ways to predict daily training paces based on other daily health stats: sleep, hrv trend, prior workouts, etc.
