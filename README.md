## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe, and I'm a data analyst with experience across the data spectrum from business intelligence, data analysis, data engineering, and data science. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to deepen my data skills outside of a consulting context to build depth to my breadth across the entire ecosystem
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willsjoseph/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spent my 2019 sabbatical taking an Italian Immersion course in Florence (Ciao!) and I'm also a Citizen Archivalist with the National Archives
